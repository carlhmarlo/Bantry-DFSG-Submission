# Bantry-DFSG-Submission
Team Bantry Submission for Data Science For Social Good Datathon

Please note: 

We have provided an R notebook, which has all the code used to generate findings and plots that appear in the presentation. 
It also goes further than what is presented, with additional plots and stats.  

The R notebook was provided in HTML and Jupyter Notebook format.  
- The Jupyter Notebook will run the code (if the file is in the correct path location)  
- The HTML is provided for ease of viewing - but the code will not run.  
The code should run in R or R Studio (if all libraries are improrted and file path is correct)

A couple of the plots in the presentation were generated using the data here but in Tableau. 
- The datasets for these are provided in the relvant section of the notebooks.
- Here are the links to the Tableau Plots

The presentation is also part of the repo (Bantry DFSG Submission.pptx) and so is the transcript(Transcript.txt)
